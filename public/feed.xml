It was part of a larger problem in my process.In this post I want to cover ways, where split focus can creep in, and the purpose of each step, so you can gain understanding for avoiding split focus.

To the extent, it can make you think, let’s get bootstrap (or another) and see what happens.I genuinely believe there is no harm in making your own. I started one a couple of years ago and have just got back to it recently (as I have been focused more on designing lately). It isn’t in too bad shape, but it’s made me evaluate it and begin refining it again. There’s value in creating your own if you use it regularly and keep it up to date.]]></description>

For me not sketching your website before going into a wireframe or design, means you’re missing out!Just because you feel like you can’t sketch, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. After all, you’re capable of building a website, and at some point in the past you weren’t. In this post, I’ll show you my process and how to sketch websites.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Grunticon updated to V2 a while ago now and what came with it was the ability to insert inline SVG. This is great because it can generate the necessary fallbacks and not ruin layout in old browsers with the presence of an <svg> tag. The main benefit of having your SVG inline is it can be easily modified with CSS.All this is done by running a grunt task. However, if you’re not too familiar with using Grunt, or want to avoid build tools altogether, it’s not possible at this stage. I have wrote previously on an alternative approach, however it doesn’t have the inline SVG benefits.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[One of the trickiest things to deal with cross browser is the styling of form elements. All browsers influence these strictly, but over the years the ‘appearance’ property has been present in WebKit and Blink browsers, and Firefox to help gain some control. More recently it’s been added to Edge. It is a little more to it than just using this property. I’ll explain the advantages and drawbacks to this and how I handle it. The goal of this post is to give you the base for you to apply your visual style on top of. I will be covering text, button and select elements.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Following on nicely from the previous post. One of the things with critical path CSS, is you can’t use wp_enqueue_style. It’s not a huge deal, as the easiest way to get around it is by putting it in your <head> the regular way. Though when you combine that with cookies and <noscript> tags, it can make for quite a messy <head>. Particularly for a Wordpress template, as I have found in the past..In this post I will show you how to avoid this. It’s similar to the way Wordpress recommends you queue your scripts and styles.]]></description>

The issue with that is when JavaScript isn’t available the cookie will not be set. Not a huge deal as the website, would still function.When it comes to Wordpress, it’s not as straight forward as using setcookie in your header.php file or another less than ideal location.

You may have been used to an approach that involved setting up, two separate menus, within Wordpress. May you added a link to ‘home’ in between the items in a single menu. Or worse still you used JavaScript to change the position. Each of them have a less than ideal feeling to it. This is where flexbox can really help.]]></description>

However, with the experience of seeing how people struggle with the topic of vertical rhythm, it was best to keep it for a separate post.I will assume you do have a grasp of vertical rhythm, at this point, otherwise some parts may not make sense.
