## Creating posts
<details>
<summary>How to create and manage blog posts</summary>

### Starting a new post
1. Create a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b post/your-post-name
```

2. Generate the post:
```bash
node ./scripts/compose.js
```

3. Follow the prompts for:
   - Post title
   - File extension (md or mdx)
   - Post status (open, draft, closed)

### Post structure
Posts can be created in two formats:

1. Single file:
```
content/blog/0177-your-post-title.mdx
```

2. Directory with index file (for posts with assets):
```
content/blog/0177-your-post-title/
  ├─ index.mdx
  ├─ image.png
  └─ other-assets/
```

### Post id system
- IDs are automatically managed:
  - `compose.js` scans existing posts to assign the next available ID
  - GitHub Actions handle ID conflicts during pull requests
  - Pre-merge-commit hook ensures ID uniqueness when merging

### Publishing workflow
1. Create your post on a new branch
2. Make your changes and commit
3. Create a pull request
4. The system will automatically:
   - Check for ID conflicts
   - Update IDs if needed
   - Handle merging safely

<summary>Collections</summary>
The collections script helps manage design and development resource links. It supports both individual entries and bulk imports.

### Adding individual collections
Run the script without arguments for interactive mode:

```bash
node scripts/compose-collection.js
```

You'll be prompted for:
- Title: Name of the resource
- URL: Web address
- Collection: Category (e.g., Inspiration, Typography, UX Design)
- Kind: Type of resource (website, article, resource, or tool)
- Extension: File format (md or mdx)

Example output:
```bash
Title: Awesome Design System
URL: https://design-system-example.com
Collection: Inspiration
Kind: website
Extension: md
Collection item generated successfully at content/collections/design-system-example.md
```

### Bulk import
To import multiple items, create a JSON file with your collections and pass it to the script:

```bash
node scripts/compose-collection.js bookmarks.json
```

JSON file structure:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Example Site",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "collection": "Inspiration",
    "kind": "website",
    "extension": "md"
  }
]
```

Example output:
```bash
Created: example
Created: another-example
Import complete: 2 items processed
```

#### Fields:
- `title`: Resource name (required)
- `url`: Web address (required)
- `collection`: Category name (required)
- `kind`: Type of resource (optional, defaults to 'website')
  - Options: website, article, resource, tool
- `extension`: File format (optional, defaults to 'md')
  - Options: md, mdx

The script automatically:
- Generates unique filenames from URLs
