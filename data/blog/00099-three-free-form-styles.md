This is one of the first things; I’ve worked on aside from what’s posts, to give away. It’s quite difficult to figure out what to design to give away, without just adding to the masses of things out there already. I’ve decided to code up some form styles. So you should be able to grab their styles and apply them right away to your forms. There are three variations.

## Style one
<p data-height="480" data-theme-id="13022" data-slug-hash="LpjoLx" data-default-tab="result" data-user="stevemckinney" className="codepen">See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/stevemckinney/pen/LpjoLx/'>Dimensional form style</a> by Steve (<a href='http://codepen.io/stevemckinney'>@stevemckinney</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

## Style two
<p data-height="480" data-theme-id="13022" data-slug-hash="EVoeaX" data-default-tab="result" data-user="stevemckinney" className="codepen">See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/stevemckinney/pen/EVoeaX/'>Flat form style</a> by Steve (<a href='http://codepen.io/stevemckinney'>@stevemckinney</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

## Style three
<p data-height="480" data-theme-id="13022" data-slug-hash="xwpmpj" data-default-tab="result" data-user="stevemckinney" className="codepen">See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/stevemckinney/pen/xwpmpj/'>Bulky form style</a> by Steve (<a href='http://codepen.io/stevemckinney'>@stevemckinney</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

## Usage
Each element requires the `.input-base` class. This applies a reset, that [I have wrote about previously](/blog/how-to-consistently-style-form-elements).

### Text fields (text, email, textarea, etc)
These require the `.input-text` class. The only difference between these is I’ve applied a `min-height` to the textarea.

### Select field
These require the `.input-select` class.

### Checkbox
These require the `.input-checkbox` class.

### Radio
These require the `.input-radio` class.

### Submit button
These require the `.button` class.
