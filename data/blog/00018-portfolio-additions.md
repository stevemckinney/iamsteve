I've added a couple of things to my portfolio as of recent. They're the "personal website" and my business card. Just to try show a variation of my skills. If you would like to view them, see my [portfolio](http://iamsteve.me/portfolio "View my portfolio for the new designs added"). As for the business card, I'll be getting a physical picture of it up ASAP, I can't find my cameras USB cable and an iPhone 3G picture doesn't cut it.

## Other news

I've also been working on a competition entry within Manchester for Drivesafe, it ends at midnight tonight (17th November). So the results for it should be announced relatively soon after, I'm hoping it'll be a day or so. At the same time I'm praying I win as it will be a pretty big achievement and having my work saw by a lot more people than this site gets. For what we had to do; the idea was vague, we had to design a landing page and branding for Drivesafe and have a button saying "Enter site" but somehow get across the dangers of using handheld devices in public, with a bit of content. I'm quite pleased with my entry and I'll be putting it in my portfolio fairly soon, probably after the winner is announced.
