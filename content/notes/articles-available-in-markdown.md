summary: It’s possible an LLM might find it useful, or yourself.

Traffic has taken a sharper decline. It never had much to begin, but it feels like a more significant dip rather than the steady decline over the years.

The content isn’t necessarily fresh, things are evolving in how we browse and I guess I’m using that to try something or as an acknowledgement?

There is the effect of AI now, that’s driving how we consume things, share things, put in the effort to learn or do things.

I agree with a lot of the sentiment surrounding AI but it’s a welcomed part of my workflow in many cases. It’s helping me build more and get rid of the tedious stuff.

Like a fair few years ago AI would have been useful in exporting and converting articles when I moved from being on a CMS. I had to do it mostly manually as I couldn’t find a means to do it.

I’ve always been a designer first and foremost, and the learning and practice side is always a split between be a better designer and knowing more code. There’s just not enough time.

Googling has been progressively getting worse, which isn’t news. Google encourages the worst in how to create a website. And it’s swayed my opinion on how we’re going to find things.

So I feel like I want to position this website towards that a little, again whatever that looks like.

But I’ve written this to say: articles on this website can be viewed in Markdown by adding `.md` to the end of a URL.
