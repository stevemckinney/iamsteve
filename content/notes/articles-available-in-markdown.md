summary: It’s possible an LLM might find it useful, or yourself.

Traffic has been in steady decline on this website. It’s easy to see why the content isn’t fresh and I don’t post frequently enough. Something feels different though.

There is the effect of AI now, that’s driving how we consume things, share things, put in the effort to learn or do things. I’ve certainly noticed the change in how I browse for solutions.

Combined with Googling being worse, which isn’t a revelation. It’s encouraged the worst in how to create a website. And that has swayed my opinion on how we’re going to find things.

This combined with seeing things around making your website easier to access for LLM’s in markdown feels like the next wave of “SEO”.

There’s nothing to gain or lose from this, as everything is available to the public on [Github](https://github.com/stevemckinney/iamsteve). Anyway, I’ve written this to say: articles on this website can be viewed in Markdown by adding `.md` to the end of a URL.
