Traffic has taken a sharper decline to this website than normal. It never had much to begin, but it feels like a more significant dip than normal.

The content isn’t necessarily fresh, things are evolving in how we browse and I guess I’m using that to try something or as an acknowledgement?

There is the effect of AI now, that’s driving how we consume things, share things, put in the effort to learn or do things.

And AI has become part of my workflow. I agree with a lot of the sentiment surrounding AI and fully aware that I’m a contradiction. But there’s no doubting it is changing things and making certain areas more efficient.

It’s helping me build more. I’ve always been a designer first and foremost, and the learning side is always a split between be a better designer and knowing enough code. There’s just not enough time.

Googling has been progressively getting worse, which isn’t news. Google encourages the worst in how to create a website. And it’s swayed my opinion on how we’re going to find things.

So I feel like I want to position this website towards that a little, again whatever that looks like.

But articles on this website can be viewed in Markdown by adding `.md` to the end of a URL.
