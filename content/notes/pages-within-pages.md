A pattern I've noticed is what feels like pages within pages. These seemingly contain a large amount of information expanding upon a section within a page.

I first noticed it with Apple products. The example here builds upon the processor section in more detail.

My initial impressions is it's a bit of an app crossover to retain context within the initial page. You can browse a page, expand the detail, return back to where you were.

There's been two "high-profile" examples recently from Stripe and Linear which do similarly.

<div className="flex gap-4">

Pages are striving to be succinct as possible, but there's always the nagging feeling of "I'm not representing this feature as to its full extent as it is". And expanding it on this way, is may be how it's come to. I know I've relied on this in more sales focused journeys not wanting to overwhelm the customer.

But this pattern feels like it's inspired by Notion and similar apps. You pop in and out of content rows, edit a bit, return to your database. Pages within pages in Notion feel a seamless pattern whether that is a popover or navigating through.

However it strikes me as should that just be a page anyway and the back button is still useful? But it wouldn't be as designed.
