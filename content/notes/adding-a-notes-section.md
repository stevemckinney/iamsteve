summary: A place for things outside of design and code focused articles.

It’s been on my mind for a little while if it’s worth just having an open stream of consciousness to ‘blog’. I’ve liked what [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/), [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/) and [Louie Mantia](https://lmnt.me) do in the sense they post what they want and share their interests. Then there’s what [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) and [Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com/) have with the digital garden.

## Building a more evergreen website

I’ve been thinking of expanding in different areas of this website since redesigning back in 2024.

The direction is set around web design craft and seeing the digital garden approach this has allowed me to shift my mindset a bit. I can still do this by having the “/blog”, as I see this as the reason people visit or articles are indexed. But I want to allow myself more freedom with notes.

### Expanding beyond blog posts

I want to build out different areas, I have an idea for a “letterforms” section, or rather a more typography focused section. I’d like to use this as a way to explore typography, through pairings and anatomical features.

Type design trends come and go also, but this will be a growing collection. It’ll be “typewolf-esque”, but I want to add my own spin.

### My own “gallery” and “collectibles”

I’d like to use this notes section to post design practice, which can fuel ideas for blog posts or to build out a “patterns” section.

I want it to almost be a place where I collect things and be kind of fun. I started this with [<Icon size={24} icon="collections" class="fill-none" /> Collections](/collections) for a link library. I intend to build upon this further as I've been prototyping some ideas.

Let’s see where I go with this.
