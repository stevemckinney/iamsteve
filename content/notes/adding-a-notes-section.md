summary: A place for things outside of design and code focused articles.

It’s been on my mind for a little while if it’s worth just having an open stream to ‘blog’. I’ve liked what (Chris Coyier)[https://chriscoyier.net/], (Dave Rupert)[https://daverupert.com/] and Louie Mantia do in the sense they post what they want and share their interests. Then there’s what Maggie Appleton and Chris Ferdinandi have with the digital garden.

## Building a more evergreen website

I’ve been thinking of expanding in different areas of this website since redesigning back in 2024.

The direction is set around web design craft and seeing the digital garden approach this has allowed me to shift my mindset a bit. I can still do this by having the “/blog” side of it (whatever that is realistically) but allow myself more freedom with notes.

## Expanding beyond blog posts

I want to build out different areas, I have an idea for a “letterforms” section or more typography focused. I’d like to use this as a way to explore typography through specific typefaces, pairings and anatomical features.

### My own “gallery” and “collectibles”

I’d like to use this notes section to post design practice, which can possibly expand into blog posts or to build out a “patterns” section.

I want it to almost be a place where I collect things and to be more evergreen. I started this with [<Icon size={16} icon="collections" /> Collections](/collections) for a link library—I intend to build upon this further I've been prototyping some ideas here.
