    ## Who is this for?
    Either you’re a developer wanting to improve their visual design skills, or a designer with some coding experience. You’re someone who understands the value of not only good design, but the requirement of making it look visually appealing too. Through sharing what I know and continue to learn, I hope to meet this need.

    A thing that has always driven my writing is hearing things like “you can’t expect your designs to look the same as they do in <em>design app</em>”. And while that comes from a good place, it’s always struck me as a way to avoid challenges and learning something new.


    ## Changing aim over the years
    I made a decision to start writing this blog <em>consistently</em> in January 2015. Every week, for two years, a blog post went out. I started out writing about anything I was interested in, as long as it was related to websites.

    It became clear to me over those two years, there was a lack of content focusing on the visual side of design. It’s tough to teach, that’s why, or maybe that’s just me.

    As a designer, it’s the thing I aspire to be best at. And having this website as a place to explore and challenge myself. Through an approach where I consider the decisions I’m making—some of these are routine but are valuable.

    Eventually, I stopped posting frequently for various reasons. I’ve accepted I’ll always be figuring things out, but with a vision in mind I can work towards my goal. I hope I’ll post regularly again.

    ## About me

    I’m a designer for the web based in Manchester. I specialise in visual design and user experience for websites. I enjoy building websites and writing about CSS, outside of just design.

    My experience spans agency and in-house, working with a variety of clients in differing industries and differing needs, shops, subscriptions, services and marketing.

    As a designer, someone might ask if you have a personal style. I do feel I have a personal style, I enjoy serif typefaces, use of colour, using illustration over photography. However, I will always design for the audience, goals and systems that are already in place with the brand. It’s good to have constraints.

    Generally, I think it’s an enjoyment of creating things on the web. Be it icons, animation, illustration, CSS or JavaScript.

    ## Design history
    Here is the design history of this website. The first version of this website I started working on in 2009, so you can see how my design sensibility has evolved over the years. Version two onwards I have written about.
