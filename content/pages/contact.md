  ## Critique
  It’s always helpful, it will help me to improve. And it helps me to focus on the right topics. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I’ll be grateful for you taking the time.

  ## I’m stuck with a post
  If you’re stuck with a post, I may be able to steer you in the right direction. I can’t solve for every use case, but yours may be a good addition for the post. The following may help speed things up:

  - Describe the problem
  - What you’re trying to achieve
  - If it’s code related make a CodePen
  - Provide any links to work so I can see errors
  - Don’t send login details by email

  ## Report a broken page
  Maybe you’ve found an error, typo or can’t access something. Thank you for taking the time to bring it to my attention. I’ll update it.
