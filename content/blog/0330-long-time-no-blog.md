summary: "I guess this is a hello, and one of my infrequent blog posts. As you can see the site is different, it’s not fully complete but I felt I should update the whole site. My portfolio and about pages aren’t complete, yes I brought the about page back. After my portfolio is complete I shall follow it up with a write up about this design, it’s more or a less just a refresh of the old design, a clean up, and needed redesign/realign?"

I guess this is a hello, and one of my infrequent blog posts. As you can see the site is different, it's not fully complete but I felt I should update the whole site. My portfolio and about pages aren't complete, yes I brought the about page back. After my portfolio is complete I shall follow it up with a write up about this design, it's more or a less just a refresh of the old design, a clean up, and needed redesign/realign?

Nonetheless, there is probably bits that aren't totally perfect (the contact page needs the responsiveness sorting properly). I have been working on this design on and off I think for the past 6 months. I spent 2 months of that totally design/web free, it was a break I sorely needed, but that's more of a personal matter. Anyway I'm pleased with the design and overall functioning of it, it adapts nicely for devices on iOS 5 particularly the navigation — the one you'll see if you resized is altered for iOS 5. Anyway more of that in the follow up post.
