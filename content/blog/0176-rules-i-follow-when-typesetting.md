When writing or typesetting a design, I have things I follow in terms of creating a good flow to the article or balance within a page. However, I always believe in pragmatism with rules like this as there are things out of your control, like screen size, varying content, etc.

It’s important to aim for the ideal, but not to the detriment of creating something unmaintainable.

Here’s the things I’m going to cover
1. Avoid sentences or punctuating titles where possible
2. Even more so when the title is central
3. Use the correct type of dash
4. Everything is sentence case
5. Use the correct quotes
6. Pragmatically avoid orphans and widows
7. Pragmatically hang lists and punctuation
8. Everything is left aligned unless the composition is better for it
9. When emphasising or linking text punctuation should not be part of it
10. Use paragraphs to create help rhythm
  - Headings should never follow headings
  - Images should never follow images
15. Don’t overdo punctuation
16. Line height is proportional to size
17. Letter spacing or tracking is proportional to size

## Line height is proportional to size and depends on the typeface
There’s a few things that can affect the line height you should choose.

- The proportions of the typeface, such as x height, the ascenders and descenders
- Where you’re using the type, eg: hero
- How often this needs to change
- What control over the change you have

For example, in a hero title you can afford to be really precise in your line height. Where sections are repeatable components, you may not have the freedom. As descenders may clash with other letters.

## Letter spacing or tracking is proportional to size and line length
Like line height, I don’t think you can apply a simple percentage rule to any typeface. It takes a little tweaking depending on the typeface you’re using. Think of a display typeface versus a text typeface. Using them at varying sizes will require different extremes of tracking.

## Everything is left aligned
The vast majority of the design should be aligned to the left (or right if your language is right to left).

It means your right side of text has a ragged edge which makes it easy to scan. Especially for article reading it makes absolutely no sense.

If you have to centralise text and it is valid to do so, it needs to be a small amount of text. People don’t want to be reading centralised paragraphs. A sentence at most.

## Avoid punctuating titles where possible
I will try to avoid punctuation in a title because it looks messy. I find it’s difficult to apply with consistency. If one title is punctuated it will stand out more when another isn’t.

### Watch out for full stops in centralised titles
This is most obvious in hero sections with centralised text. It stands out more on mobile.

As a separate line it’s similar to the punctuation, but where you have a central title with a full stop at the end the final line will feel off optically.

## Use the correct type of dash
I’d recently heard a pointer for identifying AI copy was the use of the em (—) dash. Which feels unfair, but I see it, AI does like to use them. I hope doesn’t lead to a lack of their use—as I like to use them.

[0176-typesetting-dash]

I do wonder if this comes from the assumption that the judge of the writing assumes the writer doesn’t know how to use them? Which is where I was going with that. And knowing where to use each dash ensures your writing is typographically correct.

### Hyphens (-)
Hyphens are used to join words to create meaning or indicate where a word breaks within a sentence to maintain grammatical correctness.

### En-dash (–)
The name comes from the letter ‘n’ as the character tends to be the width of the letter ‘n’. But its use is important to understand.

It’s used to indicate a range. It could be a range of numbers, dates or start and end of a destination eg: MAN–LON.

### Em-dash (—)
The easiest way I remember how to use an em-dash is as more of a substitute for a commas, parentheses or semicolons.

I see it as a way to break up a sentence. The statement you write in between the dashes should make sense on its own and the sentence should make sense on its own if the statement between the dashes is removed.

I could be wrong here, but that is my understanding.

### Composing sentences with em-dashes
My stylistic preference, when writing a sentence that contains an em-dash it shouldn’t have spaces before and after it. You can use a `&thinsp;` but otherwise no space is preferred.

For example
> Design is not just what it looks like and feels like — design is how it works

> Design is not just what it looks like and feels like—design is how it works

### Keyboard shortcuts
The em and en dash have keyboard shortcuts to access. Hyphen is obvious… but for en-dashes it is <kbd><kbd>option</kbd><kbd>-</kbd></kbd> and for em-dashes <kbd><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>option</kbd><kbd>-</kbd></kbd>.

## Everything is sentence case
Everything, whether that is a heading, button, navigation link or whatever else you can think of. It’s sentence case—no exceptions.

It should go without saying but the only exceptions are names or someting important like ‘I’.

Sentence case is superior for readability and remembering the system. Is it the first letter or is it a name? Simple. The inconsistency at which people apply title case is enough to oppose it when setting a style guide.

## Use the correct quotes
I’ve put this before in a previous article, but let’s go over it again. There’s straight quotes and curly quotes. Curly quotes are more complementary with your typeface.

[0176-typesetting-quotes]

The best reference for the usage of quotes smartquotesforsmartpeople.com. The shortcuts are fairly simple, but it’s better if you have something to do it automatically for you as it can be easily missed.

**Opening double quote**
<kbd><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>option</kbd><kbd>[</kbd></kbd>

**Closing double quote**
<kbd><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>option</kbd><kbd>]</kbd></kbd>

**Opening single quote**
<kbd><kbd>option</kbd><kbd>[</kbd></kbd>

**Closing single quote**
<kbd><kbd>option</kbd><kbd>]</kbd></kbd>

When dealing with automatic transformation into them. Many apps do this by default. For code, you’ll need to use a library like smartypants.

## When emphasising or linking text the full stop shouldn’t be included
This is a small detail, but the vast majority of the time and more so with linking you shouldn’t include the full stop.

## Paragraphs can help to create rhythm
When things like other headings, lists, buttons follow a heading; it can create a sense of awkwardness in an article or design.

Why? For me it’s down to the presence of the thing following the heading. A heading following a heading may not feel right. A button following a heading will likely feel out of place, etc.

[img demo-different-situations]

The spacing flows much better when there is a paragraph to break it up. Your rhythm suffers when there isn’t.

Sometimes you can’t avoid it and it shouldn’t be at the expense of unnatural writing or forcing it but it’s a conscious effort I make.

## Don’t overdo punctuation
You might feel that
