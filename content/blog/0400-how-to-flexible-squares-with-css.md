How do you maintain a perfect square shape with a responsive layout? The solution appears simple; the only issue is your content. Which if you want to maintain a square shape it should be able to accommodate the content. I’ll show you how to do it in with this quick tip.

## The problem
So you have a row of items that you want to maintain a 1:1 ratio. Then as you resize the screen you want those to retain that ratio and adjust at certain breakpoints and continue to with the square shape.

## The solution for elements without container
To solve this problem we need to use a percentage padding on the bottom. The value of the `padding-bottom` must be equal to the `width`. So if I have a row with four items, that means the padding would need to be 25%.

### HTML
Your HTML may look something like this.

```markup
<div class=“row”>
  <div class=“square”>
  </div>
  <div class=“square”>
  </div>
  <div class=“square”>
  </div>
  <div class=“square”>
  </div>
</div>
```

### CSS required
The basic CSS requires the expected `width` and `padding-bottom`. The `height` is for security, in making sure you start from 0.

```css
.square {
  width: 25%;
  height: 0;
  padding-bottom: 25%; }
```

## The solution for working with grids
If your items are within grid layout, understandably so, this affects the padding-bottom. In this case, it’s just 100% for all.

### HTML
Your HTML may look something like this.

```markup
<div class=“grid”>
  <div class=“grid-cell grid-25”>
    <div class=“square”></div>
  </div>
  <div class=“grid-cell grid-25”>
    <div class=“square”></div>
  </div>
  <div class=“grid-cell grid-25”>
    <div class=“square”></div>
  </div>
  <div class=“grid-cell grid-25”>
    <div class=“square”></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### CSS required
Essentially the same aside from our values. Depending on your element, it’s possible the width is redundant if it's a block level element.

```css
.square {
  width: 100%;
  height: 0;
  padding-bottom: 100%; }
```

## Borders can affect dimensions
As it’s common practice having `box-sizing` set to `border-box`, adding a border to the outermost element will change the dimensions. This is something to be aware of, and you will need to make adjustments.

An option is to use `calc()` and subtract the border from the `width` and `padding-bottom`. Using `box-sizing: content-box`, will remove this issue but with that, you create another problem.
