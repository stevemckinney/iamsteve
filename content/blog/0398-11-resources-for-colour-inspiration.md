Following on from the colour series I have a selection of websites that can help inspire your colour palettes. There is a variety between inspiration, resources and tools to pick colours.

## [Colour Lovers](http://colourlovers.com)

</div>

A continual source of inspiration for me, I use it to add weight to my colour choices or identify nice pairings. I particularly like the variety of ways you can discover colours.

## [Color Hunt](http://colorhunt.co)
<div className="article-image">

</div>

Color Hunt posts colour palettes that have 4 colours each. It’s a great source of inspiration as the majority are pleasing combinations.

## [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com)

</div>

Previously Kuler, it’s Adobes source of colour inspiration. It makes for a great addition between Adobe apps and you can save palettes and sync them between Adobe apps. You’re presented with a colour picker which can help your choices.

## [Collor](http://colllor.com)
<div className="article-image">

</div>

Colllor is really useful for helping to pick tints and shades. It’s also very helpful when you want a colour that’s somewhere inbetween two colours.

## [colourco.de](http://colourco.de/)
<div className="article-image">

</div>

This is an interesting way to pick a palette. Move your cursor about and click. I like how you see the palette in a large space, as I’ve mentioned in this colour series post, you need to see your palettes in a variety of cases.

## [The Days Color](http://thedayscolor.com/)
<div className="article-image">

</div>

It appears to be an inactive site now but it’s a great source of inspiration. Each palette mentions where it drew the inspiration from, which can serve as a reminder for you to look elsewhere if you’re struggling for inspriation.

## [Paletton](http://paletton.com/)
<div className="article-image">

This has long been a go to website for me to use its colour wheel capabilities. It serves well as a reference for complementary colours and ideas of what could work well if you’re stuck. It’s quite rare I use the colour suggestions, but if I like what I see I usually will tweak them.

## [Plenty of Colour](http://plentyofcolour.com/)
<div className="article-image">

</div>

One of my most favourite things is using the world around us for colour inspiration and this blog focuses around that.

## [Canva colour theory](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/)
<div className="article-image">
  [<Image src="/images/blog/cr-canva.png" width={890} height={587} />](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/)
</div>

This is a broad article on colour theory, the page itself is a doorway to their other articles. Again there are palettes from photos from everyday things.

## [Wes Anderson Palettes](http://wesandersonpalettes.tumblr.com)
<div className="article-image">
  [<Image src="/images/blog/cr-wesanderson.png" width={890} height={587} />](http://wesandersonpalettes.tumblr.com)
</div>

Wes Anderson is known for the attention to colour throughout film. This tumblr focuses on that. It’s highly inspirational. I especially like how it shows you can use a large variety of colours harmoniously, without being overbearing.

## [Color Template](http://rocket-design.fr/color-template/)

This is a really handy and well designed guide on making colour palettes. I really like the approach to this.
