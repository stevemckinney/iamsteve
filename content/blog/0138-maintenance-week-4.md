Maintenance weeks are where detail website tasks, instead of a regular post. I spend time fixing bugs, updating grammar and posts in general, as well as adding featured images. It varies what I will do, and this posts serves as detailing what has been done.

So while it’s not a post that directly gives value, it helps me keep on top of the library of content that I am acquiring.

## Illustrator stroke profiles
This has become a really popular post in recent weeks. It was one I wrote quite early on in this writing weekly thing and on inspecting it again, it’s quite poorly formatted in terms of the images. So I have improved some of them.

## Hero area series: selective refresh bug
I spotted a bug within the template files — a simple, but crucial one really — to do with the refreshing background colour. It had stopped working, for whatever reason. I needed to  add `echo` to a function to make sure the style output. Strange, but annoying.

## Progress
I spent the majority of this week sifting through posts and styling the various elements I use throughout. How they adapt with the screen and such.

I’m happy with the homepage, but I’m considering a rework of that as the current layout doesn’t adapt too well in the mid size range of screens, but I know I can do better. It’s just trying to think of a better solution.

## Preparations for the redesign
I’m hoping to launch the redesign first week of September, which is a good time for me due to having a week off work. This means I’ve begun focusing my efforts much more on the redesign, [as I mentioned a few posts back](/blog/redesign-progress-update). It’s difficult to balance and progress suffers on both writing and the redesign.

I spent some time designing more featured images and tweaking posts.

### Preparation
As I’ve been working on the website I’ve been trying to keep the database in sync locally, as I post and update images. As I have a couple of CMS addons that are not currently on this site, it causes an error every time.

I uploaded and enabled the addons here and other things round making sure when I put this live there is as few hiccups. Steps like this that don’t affect anything, just mean one less thing to rush and do.
