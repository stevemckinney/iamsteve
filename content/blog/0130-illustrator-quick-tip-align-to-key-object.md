Aligning to a key object in Illustrator is one of the most useful alignment options. If you’ve ever been frustrated with aligning objects centrally, then everything nudges over a few pixels. This is where align to key object comes in, read on for how to.

## When and why
The most common use case I can think of is making buttons. You’ve got a rectangle, above that is some text, which you want to align centrally. The rectangle is positioned correctly, your text isn’t. **You use the alignment tools and everything is now off by a few pixels**. This is the perfect use case for align to key object.

## How to
<div className="article-image">
  <Image src="/images/blog/align-button.gif" unoptimized={true} width={738} height={420} />
</div>

To align to key object you must select two items and then change the ‘Align To’ option to Align to Key Object. **The crucial part is then clicking the item you want to use to for aligning to**.

## Quicker for axis alignment

Using align to key object is a quick method for aligning horizontally or vertically. Using the same method it will help save time.

## That’s it
I do wish there was a way to somehow default this behaviour. Taking the item in the back as the key object, this would work well. Anyway, I felt this was a necessary quick tip to highlight, as I’ve found it valuable.
