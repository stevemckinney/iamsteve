## Clipping mask
A clipping mask is probably my most commonly used mask. It’s great for sizing images accurately, to a shape or making sure other layers are contained within a base layer.

## Non destructive dodge & burn
Dodge and burn are more useful for photo editing, however as websites feature photos more often than not. This should have its uses for you. Being able to darken/lighten parts of a picture can be handy for overlaying text.

<figcaption>Add a layer that’s #808080 (50% grey). Set the blending mode to overlay and do your dodging and burning over it.</figcaption>

A short post this week but I find these techniques very handy while I'm designing.
